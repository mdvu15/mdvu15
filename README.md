### :wave: Hi, I'm Minh!

I'm a first-year Master's student in Operations Research & Industrial Engineering at UT Austin :metal: I graduated from Earlham College in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science and Economics. Before rediscovering my passion for software engineering, I spent 3 years working as an actuary (and became a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries in the process).

:wrench: Technical skills: Web development, Express, Flask, Python, JavaScript, SQL, OCL.

ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: I'm a bassist and retired competitive speedcuber.

ðŸ“« I'm best reached via [email](mailto:minhvu@utexas.edu). I'm always open to new opportunities and interesting conversations.
